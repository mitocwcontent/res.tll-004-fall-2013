Summary
-------

This video leads students through using linear algebra to model a gear train. This is achieved by modeling each rigid gear body as a system of 3 equations, the input and output gears as one linear equation each, and then modeling the connection between gears as another linear equation derived from Newton’s second law. The resulting matrix is explored for consistency and design elements.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Model the forces and torques in a gear train as a system of linear equations.
*   Combine these linear equations into a matrix equation.
