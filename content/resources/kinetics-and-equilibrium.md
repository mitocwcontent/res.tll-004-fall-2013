Summary
-------

In this video, the effect of activation energy and reactant concentration on the rate of a reaction is explored. Lego® molecules are used to visualize the ideas that reactions are reversible, reaction rates change with time, and at equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Understand how reaction rate is influenced by reactant concentration.
*   Explain how reaction rates change as a system establishes equilibrium.
*   Predict relative equilibrium concentrations of reactant and product, based on rates of forward and reverse processes.
