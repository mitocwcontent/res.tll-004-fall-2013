Summary
-------

In this video, viewers explore the differences and similarities between thermal equilibrium and steady state temperature. Four scenarios are presented wherein the heat transfer between a pan and its handle, and between the handle and the room are constrained in a variety of ways, and the resultant temperature profiles are discussed. Viewers are asked to: determine whether the handle is at thermal equilibrium or steady state temperature; sketch a corresponding temperature profile in the pan-handle; and predict whether or not a particular pan-handle will be cool enough to touch.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Identify whether a system is at equilibrium and/or steady state.
*   Describe the differences and similarities between equilibrium and steady state.
