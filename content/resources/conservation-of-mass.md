Summary
-------

This video reviews the law of conservation of mass and basic stoichiometry. Students are introduced to control volumes as a conceptual tool to aid in problem solving. Students use the concepts of mass conservation and control volumes to find unknown information in examples about a growing plant (photosynthesis) and a rusting car (iron oxidation).

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video, students will be able to apply the law of conservation of mass to real-world scenarios.
