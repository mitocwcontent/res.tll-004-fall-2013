Summary
-------

In this video, Legos® are used to create possible molecular level models of a buffer. This is done to better understand how a buffer works and the components a buffer must contain in order to be effective. Students evaluate these models against a set of criteria determined at the beginning of the video and then consider other parameters that must be taken into account when designing a buffer.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

After watching this video students will be able to:

*   Describe how the structure, or composition, of a buffer functions to resist changes in pH.
*   Explain how the choices made in buffer design impact the properties of a buffer.
